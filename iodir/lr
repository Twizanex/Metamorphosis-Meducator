The diagnosis of Raynaud’s syndrome is based on the patient’s personal description of a typical vasospastic attack involving one or more fingers related to cold exposure. The exact cause of vasospastic attacks in primary Raynaud’s disease is unknown. There is an extensive list of secondary causes of Raynaud’s syndrome syndrome - connective tissue disease, occlusive arterial disease, occupational arterial disease, drug-induced vasospasm, myeloproliferative and hematologic disease, malignancy, infection. For most patients with primary Raynaud’s syndrome there is no cure; however, a number of simple measures can be effective in reducing the frequency and duration of attacks - preventive measures, avoidance of factors that cause vasoconstriction, behavioral therapies and maneuvers, temperature biofeedback.

EASA started its work in the fields of Airworthiness and will soon its competencies inter alia to Flight Operations and Flight Crew Licensing, the latter including the requirements for aeromedical assessment. The appropriate new EU Regulation will most probably be published in April. It includes the Essential Requirements for Licensing and aeromedical certification. A proposal for a new Commission Regulation promulgates the Implementing Rules for Personnel Licensing, detailing â€“ inter alia â€“ the Medical Requirements (Annex II to the Regulation). The specific rules, numeric standards are published as Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC) and Guidance Material (GM). The provisions are based on JAR-FCL 3 and have been transposed to the format choosen by EASA by a small working group of aeromedical experts (FCL.001).  Comments received by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) prompted the agencyÎ„s statement that the JAR-FCL 3 requirements for private pilots were excessive and too demanding and that a better regulation in General Aviation had to be developed. Another working group (MDM.032), including one aeromedical specialist, was tasked to draft a set of lighter requirements for non-complex aircraft used in non-commercial operations. In this context a much lighter form of aeromedical assessment - involving self-declaration by the pilot and general practitioners as asessors â€“ has been proposed.";s:21:"educationalObjectives";s:161:"To be familiar with concept for a better regulation in General Aviation.

Aviation rules and aviation medicine will get a new structure as well. The nature of air traffic required an international scope in rulemaking â€“ especially in such a confined continent as Europe with 41 countries, about 380 Million inhabitants and 317 billion person kilometres flown each year. For economic reasons it became necessary to develop common standards for certification of aircraft in the beginning of the 1970ies, maintenance followed later on. The Cyprus arrangement of 01 July 1990 created the JAA (Joint Aviation Authorities). Joint Aviation Requirements were drafted to replace existing national provisions and have been implemented from the end of the 1990ies. The areas of air operations and pilot licensing have been covered as well. The latter comprises of aviation medicine as well. The implementation of JAR-FCL 3, which covers the medical requirements for pilots, started from 1999 on in the several JAA member states. A detailed verview about development and structure of JAA, tools for harmonisation, rulemaking and amendment of requirements, medical standards, review procedures for contentious or marginal cases is described. Shortcomings were the fact that implementation was left to the discretion of the member states and that JAA had no executive power. This resulted in differences in safety and the EU commission concluded that aviation safety had to be regulated by the EU commission. After adoption of EU regulation 1592/2002 in 2002 common and binding requirements were to be drafted and a European aviation agency to be founded. EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) started its work in September 2003. Finally it will take over the role of JAA completely. Whereas Certification and Maintenance were in the focus first, Flight Operations and Licensing are going to be covered as well in the near future. Essential Requirements have been drafted, outlining â€“ inter alia - the scope of Licensing and of aeromedical aspects. However, the legislative process will most probably last at least until the end of 2007. Implementing Rules - being based on existing JAR-FCLs will be drafted soon and are going to be implemented as soon as EASA is operative for Licensing. JAR-FCL 3 will be the basis for the Implementing Rules concerning aeromedical fitness.

Jost";s:11:"description";s:2060:"In a recent review on bed rest studies of the past 20 years, it was concluded that head-down bed rest has proved its usefulness as a reliable simulation model for most physiological effects of spaceflight. Much of this research has been conducted to find countermeasures against the negative effects, which are associated with gravitational unloading. There have been partial successes in the prevention of, for example muscle wasting, cardio-vascular deconditioning, adverse metabolic changes, and bone demineralization. Reviews refer to bone-related measurements of the U.S. and Russian space programmes, as well as data from bed rest analogues, and conclude that in spite of the wealth of knowledge obtained thus far, many questions remain regarding bone loss, bone recovery, and the factors affecting these skeletal processes. Bed rest research has also direct relevance for medical science on Earth. Valuable data on physiology and early reversible pathological changes that are associated with a sedentary lifestyle on Earth can be obtained. A good example is the conclusion from a metabolic protocol implemented during the 2001/2002 90-day ESA/CNES/NASDA male bed rest study. The results of that experiment on fatty acid oxidation suggest that Mediterranean diets should be recommended in recumbent patients. Some other unexpected results obtained during the ESA/NASA/CNES/CSA 60-day female bed rest study WISE-2005 may well prompt the development of a treatment for certain cardiac diseases. A nutritional supplement that was designed to alleviate skeletal muscle atrophy turned out to preserve cardiac muscle mass. In order to optimise bed rest research, a systematic and standardised approach will be beneficial. During the last years, serious efforts have been made towards such standardisation on an international level. It is expected that results from future studies, combined with in-flight validation, will provide the answers to many biomedical problems that currently limit safe long-duration human space exploration beyond lower earth orbit.";s:21:"educationalObjectives";s:112:"To familiarize learners with critical revisit of bed rest studies and ESA framework for future bed rest studies.";s:5:"title";s:47:"Simulating human space physiology with bed rest";}s:4:"tags";a:1:{s:7:"subject";s:30:"Bed rest study;standardisation";}s:4:"uses";a:1:{s:28:"teachingLearningInstructions";s:14:"Self-learning.";}s:8:"replinks";a:2:{s:4:"from";a:0:{}s:2:"to";a:0:{}}s:4:"name";s:47:"Simulating human space physiology with bed rest";s:8:"username";s:47:"Simulating_human_space_physiology_with_bed_rest";s:4:"guid";s:4:"2647";}i:2639;O:16:"LearningResource":7:{s:8:"metadata";a:4:{s:7:"creator";s:61:"Panos Bamidis;Stathis Konstantinidis;Evdokimos Konstantinidis";s:11:"description";s:112:"To present a new System of Smoking Cessation Network and to provide information regarding hte use of the system.";s:21:"educationalObjectives";s:252:"To familiarize the learners with Electronic Health Record of Smoking Cessation Network To familiarize the learners with elearning environment of Smoking Cessation Network To familiarize the learners with communication forum of Smoking Cessation Network";s:5:"title";s:39:"Creation of a Smoking Cessation Network";}s:4:"tags";a:1:{s:7:"subject";s:80:"communication forum;Smoking Cessation database;WEB 2.0;EHR;elearning environment";}s:4:"uses";a:1:{s:28:"teachingLearningInstructions";s:34:"Directed-learing or self learning.";}s:8:"replinks";a:2:{s:4:"from";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"2632";}s:2:"to";a:0:{}}s:4:"name";s:39:"Creation of a Smoking Cessation Network";s:8:"username";s:39:"Creation_of_a_Smoking_Cessation_Network";s:4:"guid";s:4:"2639";}i:2632;O:16:"LearningResource":7:{s:8:"metadata";a:4:{s:7:"creator";s:150:"Stathis Th.

The problem is that most of the accidents in this environment have been attributed to human error. The objective of this study was to assess complex cognitive performance as it interacts with respiratory insufficiency at altitudes of 8000 feet and identify the potential effect of hypoxia on safe performance. Methods: Twenty subjects participated in the study, divided in two groups: Group I with mild asymptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and Group II with normal respiratory function. Altitude was simulated at 8000 ft. using gas mixtures. Results: Individuals with mild COPD experienced notable hypoxemia with significant performance decrements and increased number of errors at cabin altitude, compared to normal subjects, whereas their blood pressure significantly increased.";s:5:"title";s:56:"High altitude cognitive performance and COPD interaction";}s:4:"tags";a:1:{s:7:"subject";s:101:"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);Blood pressure;Hypoxia;Cognitive Performance;Human error";}s:4:"uses";a:0:{}s:8:"replinks";a:2:{s:4:"from";a:0:{}s:2:"to";a:0:{}}s:4:"name";s:56:"High altitude cognitive performance and COPD interaction";s:8:"username";s:56:"High_altitude_cognitive_performance_and_COPD_interaction";s:4:"guid";s:4:"2555";}i:2548;O:16:"LearningResource":7:{s:8:"metadata";a:3:{s:7:"creator";s:58:"A.

Such data acquisition and processing systems are becoming increasingly miniaturised, flexible and pervasive, while data is being collected from inside the human body as well as around it.

Gravity is no exception. Access to space has made it possible for us to begin the exploration of how gravity has influenced our evolution, our genetic make-up and our physiology. Identifying the thresholds at which each body system perceives, how much, how often, how long the gravity stimulus is needed and in which direction should it be presented for maximum effectiveness, is fundamental knowledge required for using artificial gravity as a therapeutic or maintenance countermeasure treatment in exploration missions. Here on earth, although surrounded by gravity we are negligent in using gravity as it was intended, to maintain the level of health that is appropriate to living in 1G.

This happens over a number of years and the final result is based on the studentâ€™s ability to prevent global climate crisis (casualties, disease outbreaks etc). Students will do this by researching various diseases that may be spread as the result of global warming. They will make decisions on how to improve medical facilities and set policies for adapting to better cope with the changing climate and the devastating effects it could bring. There are options to research specific diseases and learn their causes and effects, and learn how they can be dealt with or prevented.  (40 minutes) The student would be able to repeat the process several times as the effects of the game are different on each turn. This way they will be able to analyse and understand the difficulty of disease prevention within a rapidly changing climate.

A digital tracing can be drawn on an image for any educational purposes. Typically, a tracing is drawn by an â€œexpertâ€ or a â€œteacherâ€ to highlight a region of interest in an image, and is treated as a layer that can remain hidden or can be visualized upon the learnerâ€™s request.  When the student chooses to practice on an image the task requested by the teacher, he or she will visualize the image, without any prompt or clue (as it typically happens with â€œhot spotsâ€) and will be able to trace or mark the image. Once the exercise is saved, the student can visualize the expert tracing and obtain immediate visual feedback.  This approach is especially useful in the medical domain because it provides the opportunity to practice the skill of perceiving the important details in an image (be it an X-ray, or any other product of an imaging diagnostic system). For example, exercises can be designed to learn the identification of anatomical structures in a teleradiographic projection, or the presence of abnormalities in an image from microscope.  An extension of the â€œtracingâ€ that must closely following some elements in the image, is the drawing of a graphical annotation that is highlight loosely an area, for example, the evidence of a clinically relevant pattern in a biosignal. We can think of this situation as producing a tracing where constraints on the drawing precision have been relaxed.";s:5:"title";s:22:"The Web-Trace Platform";}s:4:"tags";a:1:{s:7:"subject";s:97:"graphical annotation;pen-based e-learning;image collections;visual discrimination;digital tracing";}s:4:"uses";a:1:{s:28:"teachingLearningInstructions";s:708:"The Web-Trace LCMS can be used to create collections of "cases" such as diagnostic images, (bio)signal recordings, etc., annotated by the teacher in the critical regions.
