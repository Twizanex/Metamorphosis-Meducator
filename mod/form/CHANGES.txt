Changes for release 0.8.3

Fixed some weirdness in the display of the orientation option 
for when editing radio button and checkbox group definitions.
This should now display consistently.

Removed the is_keyword option as it did not do anything (in Elgg 1.x
metadata is always searchable if you have the right access level).

Fixed the display of checkbox groups (previously these would only
display properly if only one had been selected).

Added a ${_friendlytime} template variable.

Fixed several problems with the group profile display and added a
"wide tabbed" display for groups that need more room for their profile
information.

Changes for release 0.8.2

Required fields for content forms are now working again.

Added some protection against the metadata case bug:

I may have accidentally left a debugging statement in 
extended profile views in the last release  (not sure, but 
this release definitely does not have it.)

Changes for release 0.8.1

Default field access levels should now work properly.

Moving fields repeatedly up and down now works.

Skype, MSN and ICQ contact fields now display a text box (and render just as
text as well - some decoration will be added in a future release).
 
Flexgroupprofiles now always have a description field and use the one the
group already has if available.
 
Custom templates should now show all the values in tag and checkbox fields 
(previously they showed only one).
