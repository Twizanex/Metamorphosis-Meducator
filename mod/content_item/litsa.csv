The case takes students through the appropriate history, examination and investigations for such a vague presentation and soon reveals a cardiac abnormality.  The differentials of myocarditis and myocardial infarction are discussed, with interpretation of ECGs and appropriate management for both conditions explored.  Students are invited to revise the risk factors for cardiovascular disease too.  Mr Maller subsequently suffers from complications and the case discusses these and their appropriate management.|This Virtual Patient (VP) is playable using any web browser.

The case describes a 48 year old man presenting to A+E with chest pain. As the case progresses, you go through differential diagnosis as well as different management options for acute myocardial infarction. You have to decide on some initial investigations and interpret the results appropriately. The case goes through interpretation of investigations as well as indications and contraindications for each treatment modality.
