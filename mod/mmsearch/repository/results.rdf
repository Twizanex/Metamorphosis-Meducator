	<mdc:description>This is the story about a Virtual Patient called Mr Angermeier. The case describes a 48 year old man presenting to A+E with chest pain. As the case progresses, you go through differential diagnosis as well as different management options for acute myocardial infarction. You have to decide on some initial investigations and interpret the results appropriately. The case goes through interpretation of investigations as well as indications and contraindications for each treatment modality. Prior to discharge, the patient develops shock, you will have to differentiate its type and formulate a management plan.</mdc:description>
